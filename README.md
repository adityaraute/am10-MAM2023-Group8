# am10-MAM2023-Group8
Data Visualisation and Storytelling Group Project

### Context
This project was created as part of the MAM course at LBS - AM10: Data Visualisations and Storytelling.
The project analyses the livestreaming business and tries to answer questions regarding Twitch and its Monopoly


### Introduction

The livestreaming industry experienced a significant surge in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic, providing viewers with a sense of community during the lockdowns. This was particularly evident in platforms like Twitch, which saw its viewership skyrocket, with viewing hours growing by 69% year-on-year from 2020 to 2021. The industry reached a staggering 18 billion viewing hours on Twitch in 2023, a testament to its massive appeal. However, as the initial pandemic-driven surge has subsided, the industry has continued to evolve, facing new developments and challenges.


### Some key findings
One of the most notable developments in the livestreaming sector has been the emergence of 'Kick', a platform positioning itself as a formidable competitor to Twitch. Kick has quickly gained traction by signing popular streamers such as Adin Ross and XQC, capturing the attention of both consumers and industry observers. From a value proposition perspective, Kick offers a more attractive financial package to streamers with a 95/5 revenue split compared to Twitch's 50/50 split. Despite this, Twitch, with its larger user base, is likely to maintain its momentum in the foreseeable future. However, to sustain its position as a leader in the industry, Twitch will need to focus on catering to the needs of its streamers and ensuring their loyalty in the face of rising competition.
