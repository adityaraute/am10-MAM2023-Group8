The average for Twitch viewer ratio centered around 26. The chart reflects a stable annual change in Twitch's average viewer ratio, mostly within a 10% range, signifying consistent dynamics between viewers and existing channels.


# Correlation with Channels
A surge in Twitch viewership during the 2020-2021 period is likely attributed to the COVID-19 lockdowns, followed by a normalization post-pandemic as audiences spend less time on live streaming. Several peak viewerships have resulted from major gaming tournament like dota2, LOL, and PUBG.

Twitch's growth in genres like Action/Adventure, MMORPG, Shooter, Shooter/Battle Royale, and Social/Chatting until mid-2021 is evident, showcasing adaptability to diverse viewer interests. 
The mid-2021 peak is likely COVID-related, with post-pandemic declines across all genres.

The chart reveals shifting genre popularity dynamics on Twitch from 2016 to 2022. 
Notably, the proportion of watching hours for the top 10 genre groups declines, signaling a viewer preference shift towards other genres. This trend reflects a diversifying Twitch platform.

“Just Chatting” is the type of content that is leading the platform, together with "League of Legends," "Grand Theft Auto V," and "VALORANT" that  consistently ranked in the top positions. The increasing of “Just Chatting” popularity reached its peak at covid lockdown in 2022 due to the lack of in-person communication, aligning with the interest of large number of user base on Twitch community.
